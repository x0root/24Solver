A simple program that finds all possible ways to make **24** from 4 digits (1–9) using the basic operators: `+ - * /`.  
All results are filtered to show only unique valid solutions.

## Run the Program

1. Make sure [Go](https://go.dev/dl/) is installed.  
2. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/username/24-game-solver.git  
   cd 24-game-solver  
   ```
3. Run the solver:
   ```bash
   go run main.go  
   ```
4. Enter 4 digits (example: `1 2 3 4` or `1234`), and the program will search for all valid solutions.
